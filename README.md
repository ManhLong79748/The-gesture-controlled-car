This is my personal project

Descripton: The system is implemented using the C programming language for STM32 microcontrollers. It utilizes an MPU6050 gyro sensor interfaced via I2C with the STM32 to read angular acceleration values generated by hand gestures. This data is then transmitted and received using NRF24 via SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication with the microcontroller. The vehicle receives signals from NRF24 and uses them to calculate PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) values for the motors.

Hardware: STM32, mpu6050, nrf24l01, car frame, motor, l298

Software: Stm32CubeMx, stm32cubeide, KeilC, Visual Studio Code
